# Bio Pattern: Immune Response
# Triggers when drift or contradictions are detected, suggesting corrective action

id: BIO_IMMUNE_001
name: Immune Response Pattern
problem_class:
  - drift_detection
  - contradiction_handling
  - alignment_recovery
  - goal_deviation

conditions:
  - High drift score from alignment trajectory
  - Rising contradiction rate
  - Evidence of goal deviation
  - Inconsistent outputs across iterations

mechanism: |
  The immune system detects foreign antigens and mounts targeted responses.
  In reasoning, this maps to detecting drift from the mission objective
  and triggering corrective mechanisms like redundancy checks and
  falsification attempts to restore alignment.

system_mapping:
  redundancy_check: true
  force_falsification_step: true
  depth_budget_delta: 1
  confidence_penalty_delta: 0.1

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Early detection of reasoning drift
    - Proactive contradiction resolution
    - Maintains goal alignment
  risks:
    - May slow progress if triggered unnecessarily
    - Could prune valid exploratory branches

tests:
  - When drift_score > 0.3, pattern should be selected
  - When contradiction_rate > 0.2, pattern should be selected
  - redundancy_check should be true in output signals
