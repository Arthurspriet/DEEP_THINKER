# Bio Pattern: Predator-Prey Dynamics
# Adversarial falsification and challenge

id: BIO_PREDATOR_PREY_001
name: Predator-Prey Falsification Pattern
problem_class:
  - adversarial_testing
  - falsification
  - robustness_testing
  - challenge_response

conditions:
  - High confidence conclusions forming
  - Need for stress testing
  - Validation before commitment
  - Potential blind spots in reasoning

mechanism: |
  Predator-prey dynamics drive co-evolution - prey develop defenses,
  predators develop counter-strategies. This arms race strengthens both.
  In reasoning, this maps to actively challenging conclusions through
  adversarial falsification attempts, strengthening valid conclusions
  and exposing weaknesses.

system_mapping:
  force_falsification_step: true
  redundancy_check: true
  confidence_penalty_delta: 0.05
  council_diversity_min: 2

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Stress-tests conclusions
    - Exposes hidden weaknesses
    - Increases robustness of final output
  risks:
    - May undermine valid conclusions
    - Adversarial overhead

tests:
  - Should always enable force_falsification_step
  - Should require diverse council for challenge
  - Should apply moderate confidence penalty
