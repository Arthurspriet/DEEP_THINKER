# Bio Pattern: Optimal Foraging
# Balances exploration vs exploitation based on resource availability

id: BIO_FORAGING_001
name: Optimal Foraging Pattern
problem_class:
  - exploration_exploitation
  - stagnation_recovery
  - resource_discovery
  - search_strategy

conditions:
  - Evidence production has stagnated
  - Low information yield from recent steps
  - Early phase of investigation
  - Unexplored areas remain

mechanism: |
  Optimal foraging theory suggests organisms balance the cost of searching
  for new resource patches against exploiting known ones. When current
  patches are depleted (stagnation), the strategy shifts to exploration.
  In reasoning, this means diversifying search when evidence production stalls.

system_mapping:
  exploration_bias_delta: 0.15
  retrieval_diversify: true
  depth_budget_delta: 1

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Breaks out of local minima
    - Discovers new evidence sources
    - Prevents premature convergence
  risks:
    - May abandon productive lines of inquiry
    - Increases resource consumption

tests:
  - When evidence_new_count_recent == 0, pattern should score high
  - exploration_bias_delta should be positive
  - retrieval_diversify should be true
