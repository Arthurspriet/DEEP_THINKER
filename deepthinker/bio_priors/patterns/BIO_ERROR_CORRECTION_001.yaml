# Bio Pattern: DNA Error Correction
# Detecting and correcting errors through proofreading mechanisms

id: BIO_ERROR_CORRECTION_001
name: DNA Error Correction Pattern
problem_class:
  - error_correction
  - contradiction_resolution
  - consistency_maintenance
  - proofreading

conditions:
  - Contradictions detected in output
  - Inconsistent claims across phases
  - Error rate increasing
  - Quality degradation observed

mechanism: |
  DNA polymerase has proofreading ability - it can detect and correct
  mismatched base pairs during replication. Additional mismatch repair
  systems catch errors post-replication. In reasoning, this maps to
  active detection and correction of contradictions and inconsistencies.

system_mapping:
  redundancy_check: true
  force_falsification_step: true
  confidence_penalty_delta: 0.1

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Actively resolves contradictions
    - Maintains consistency
    - Prevents error propagation
  risks:
    - May over-correct valid diversity
    - Computational overhead for checking

tests:
  - When contradiction_rate is high, pattern should score high
  - redundancy_check and force_falsification_step both true
  - Should apply confidence penalty until errors resolved
