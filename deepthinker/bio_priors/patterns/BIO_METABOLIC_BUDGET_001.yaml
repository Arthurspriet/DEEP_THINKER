# Bio Pattern: Metabolic Budgeting
# Resource allocation under constraints

id: BIO_METABOLIC_BUDGET_001
name: Metabolic Budget Pattern
problem_class:
  - resource_management
  - complexity_reduction
  - budget_constraints
  - efficiency_optimization

conditions:
  - High branching factor in plan
  - Resource constraints approaching
  - Time budget running low
  - Diminishing returns detected

mechanism: |
  Organisms allocate limited metabolic resources strategically, investing
  more in critical functions and reducing expenditure on low-priority
  activities. In reasoning, this maps to pruning low-value branches and
  focusing resources on high-yield approaches when budget is constrained.

system_mapping:
  branch_pruning_suggested: true
  depth_budget_delta: -1
  exploration_bias_delta: -0.1

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Efficient resource utilization
    - Focuses on high-value paths
    - Enables completion within constraints
  risks:
    - May prune valuable exploratory branches
    - Could miss important edge cases

tests:
  - When branching factor high, pattern should activate
  - branch_pruning_suggested should be true
  - Should reduce depth budget to conserve resources
