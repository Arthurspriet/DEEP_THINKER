# Bio Pattern: Ant Trail Pheromones
# Stigmergic reinforcement of successful paths

id: BIO_ANT_TRAILS_001
name: Ant Trail Pheromone Pattern
problem_class:
  - path_reinforcement
  - collective_search
  - stagnation_recovery
  - distributed_optimization

conditions:
  - Multiple search paths available
  - Some paths yielding better results
  - Need to coordinate exploration
  - Evidence production varying by approach

mechanism: |
  Ants deposit pheromones on successful paths, creating a positive feedback
  loop that guides colony foraging. Paths with more pheromones attract more
  ants. In reasoning, this maps to reinforcing approaches that yield evidence
  while allowing alternative paths to be explored with lower priority.

system_mapping:
  exploration_bias_delta: 0.1
  retrieval_diversify: true
  council_diversity_min: 2

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Efficiently exploits successful approaches
    - Maintains exploration of alternatives
    - Emergent optimization without central control
  risks:
    - May converge prematurely on suboptimal paths
    - Pheromone (memory) decay needs management

tests:
  - When stagnation detected, pattern should encourage diversification
  - council_diversity_min should be >= 2
  - Should balance exploration and exploitation
