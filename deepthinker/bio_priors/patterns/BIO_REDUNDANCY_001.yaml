# Bio Pattern: Biological Redundancy
# Multiple verification pathways for critical functions

id: BIO_REDUNDANCY_001
name: Biological Redundancy Pattern
problem_class:
  - verification
  - error_detection
  - critical_validation
  - robustness

conditions:
  - High-stakes conclusions being formed
  - Late phase of reasoning
  - Need for validation before commitment
  - Previous contradictions detected

mechanism: |
  Biological systems employ redundancy for critical functions - multiple
  genes for essential proteins, duplicate organs, parallel neural pathways.
  In reasoning, this maps to running parallel verification when conclusions
  have high stakes or when previous errors have been detected.

system_mapping:
  redundancy_check: true
  force_falsification_step: true
  council_diversity_min: 2
  confidence_penalty_delta: 0.05

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Catches errors before commitment
    - Increases confidence in conclusions
    - Robust against single-point failures
  risks:
    - Increases computational cost
    - May delay convergence

tests:
  - In late phase, pattern should be selected
  - Both redundancy_check and force_falsification_step should be true
  - Should apply confidence penalty for caution
