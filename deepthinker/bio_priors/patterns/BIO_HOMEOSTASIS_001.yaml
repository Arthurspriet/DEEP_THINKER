# Bio Pattern: Homeostasis
# Maintains balance and stability in reasoning dynamics

id: BIO_HOMEOSTASIS_001
name: Homeostatic Balance Pattern
problem_class:
  - balance_maintenance
  - stability_control
  - drift_correction
  - oscillation_damping

conditions:
  - High uncertainty trend (increasing)
  - Evidence of oscillating conclusions
  - Drift from stable baseline
  - Resource consumption imbalance

mechanism: |
  Biological homeostasis maintains internal stability through negative
  feedback loops. In reasoning, this translates to detecting when
  conclusions are oscillating or drifting, and applying stabilizing
  pressure to return to a balanced state without overreacting.

system_mapping:
  exploration_bias_delta: -0.1
  confidence_penalty_delta: 0.05
  depth_budget_delta: 0

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Prevents runaway exploration
    - Stabilizes oscillating conclusions
    - Maintains consistent reasoning
  risks:
    - May suppress valid exploratory insights
    - Could lead to premature convergence

tests:
  - When uncertainty_trend is high positive, pattern should activate
  - exploration_bias_delta should be negative (dampening)
  - Should not significantly increase depth budget
