# Bio Pattern: Developmental Stages
# Phase-appropriate behavior based on maturity

id: BIO_DEVELOPMENTAL_STAGES_001
name: Developmental Stages Pattern
problem_class:
  - phase_adaptation
  - maturity_progression
  - developmental_timing
  - stage_appropriate_behavior

conditions:
  - Transition between phases
  - Early vs late stage reasoning
  - Need for phase-appropriate strategy
  - Maturity-dependent resource allocation

mechanism: |
  Organisms progress through developmental stages with distinct behaviors
  appropriate to each stage - embryonic cells explore; mature cells
  specialize. In reasoning, early phases should explore broadly while
  later phases should consolidate and verify.

system_mapping:
  exploration_bias_delta: 0.1
  depth_budget_delta: 1
  retrieval_diversify: true

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Appropriate behavior for each phase
    - Efficient resource allocation over time
    - Natural progression toward convergence
  risks:
    - Phase detection may be inaccurate
    - Rigid staging may miss opportunities

tests:
  - In early phase (step_index < 3), should favor exploration
  - In late phase, should favor verification
  - depth_budget_delta should support current phase needs
