# Bio Pattern: Flocking Behavior
# Coordinated movement and consensus formation

id: BIO_FLOCKING_001
name: Flocking Consensus Pattern
problem_class:
  - consensus_formation
  - coordination
  - collective_decision
  - alignment_maintenance

conditions:
  - Multiple models/views producing outputs
  - Need for coordinated conclusion
  - Disagreement between perspectives
  - Synthesis phase approaching

mechanism: |
  Flocking emerges from simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion.
  Each bird adjusts based on neighbors. In reasoning, this maps to models
  adjusting conclusions based on peer outputs, maintaining diversity while
  moving toward consensus without requiring central coordination.

system_mapping:
  council_diversity_min: 3
  redundancy_check: true
  exploration_bias_delta: -0.05

expected_tradeoffs:
  benefits:
    - Natural consensus emergence
    - Maintains valuable diversity
    - Robust to individual errors
  risks:
    - May follow incorrect majority
    - Slower convergence than dictatorial approaches

tests:
  - Should increase council diversity requirement
  - Should enable redundancy checking
  - Should slightly reduce exploration (cohesion)
